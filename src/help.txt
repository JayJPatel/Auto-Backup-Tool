Auto Backup Tool is a Windows-only command line utility that backs up files 
from a source directory to a destination directory.

1. Before running backup, enter the setup menu and select your source and 
   destination directories. Once both have been set, return to the main menu

2. Run backup! Files will be backed up to the destination directory with 
   a subdirectory named [Date_Time you backed up]

Note: This is a prototype that will be used as a reference for future projects, 
      and should NOT be used as a reliable tool to back up your personal files.
